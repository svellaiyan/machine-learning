# Capstone Project

This project is about Pneumonia Classification based on Chest X-Ray images.

## Getting Started

The input data-set is taken from Kaggle competition. Link to the data-set https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data
The data-set can also be downloaded by usin Kaggle API.

```
kaggle competitions download -c rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge
```

### Prerequisites

* Access to GPU
* 2 vCPUS
* Atleast 16 GB RAM
* Access to internet from code environment

* [Project Report]: https://github.com/svellaiyan/machine-learning/blob/master/my_submissions/capstone_project/report.pdf 
* [Modelling Notebook]: https://github.com/svellaiyan/machine-learning/blob/master/my_submissions/capstone_project/Pneumonia-Classification.ipynb
* [Modelling Notebook - Kaggle Kernel]: https://www.kaggle.com/sathya16/pneumonia-classification
* [EDA notebook]: https://github.com/svellaiyan/machine-learning/blob/master/my_submissions/capstone_project/Pneumonia-Classification-EDA.ipynb
* [Run-Details]: https://github.com/svellaiyan/machine-learning/blob/master/my_submissions/capstone_project/run-details.xlsx

### How to run
* The data-set has to be downloaded into the ../input directory.
* The analysis is split into two notebooks. 
* Pneumonia-Classification-EDA.ipynb which has exploratory analysis of the metadata of the images.
* Pneumonia-Classification.ipynb has the modelling code.
* The parameters in the modelling code has to be set before running.
* Then the notebook can be run. 

### Results
The different combination of runs are documented in the Run-Details.xlsx
